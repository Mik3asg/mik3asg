### Hi there 👋
I'm Mickael and I live in the UK. I am an IT Project Manager and I am learning Cloud Computing and DevOps during my free time. I have AWS Solutions Architect Associate accreditation from Amazon Web Services (AWS), and I am currently working on hands-on Cloud Engg projects to get more practical experiences so I can get my 1st job as a Junior AWS Cloud Engineer.
